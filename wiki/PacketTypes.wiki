#summary A broad overview over the dplay packet types that have been discovered so far.

= Introduction =

Dplay uses a plethora of different packet types to carry information.
Here is an overview over the packets that I could figure out so far.

Note that the packets I am talking about here do not include the actual updates the game sends, those will be sent via UDP using application-specific encoding of the data. (Well, unless it's a type 0x0016 packet. Getting an idea why this project is called contorted?)
