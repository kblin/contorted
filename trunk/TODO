Things to do in no particular order:

* Implement a dplay game lister that can connect to games and list basic
  information on the number of players, etc.

* Create a dplay lobby server that supports the protocol the chatconnect sample
  uses.

* Add documentation about the dplay protocol to the doc/ dir.
